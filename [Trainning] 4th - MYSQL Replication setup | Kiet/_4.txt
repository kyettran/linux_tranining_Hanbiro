MySQL-Replication Setup]

Setup with 2 servers

MySQL Version : 5.7

1. Master - Slave Type
Server1 : Master
Server2 : Slave

Master : Involve in INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE only.
Slave : Data entered /changed on the Master server needs be applied to the Slave server (enable select only)

Set the data storage location as below.
DB data : /home/MYSQLDATA
DB log : /home/MYSQLLOGS

- Create a configuration manual.
- Does the data entered on the Master server applied to all to the Slave server?
- What are the required firewall settings?
- What are the backup and restore procedures during operating?
- What are the pros of this configuration?
- What are the cons of this configuration?
- What are the precautions for usage?

- Consider which service is suitable with this configuration.

- Although there will be any problem during the test, how can you solve this problem when the log files will keep increasing with the actual service ?

It is based on the exisiting project...

Because MySQL Replication and Dual Master are in the same context, the dual master configuration is condering after completing the replication configuration.


You may refer the documents or something like that, write the relevant information. ( 2 test servers are required, 1 existing server and test server. It can also be configured as a DOCKER.)
